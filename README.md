Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython and Notebooks.




## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [healthcare capstone project](https://github.com/rahulk0407/PROJECTS/blob/master/healthcare%20capstone%20project/project_2_final.ipynb):The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
	- [NYC 311 Service Request Analysis](https://github.com/rahulk0407/PROJECTS/blob/master/NYC%20311%20Service%20Request%20Analysis/Project%203.ipynb): Performed a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls.focused on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualized the major complaint types.
Domain: Customer Service
	- [Rolando's goal](https://github.com/rahulk0407/PROJECTS/blob/master/Ronaldos_goal/ronaldo_zs.ipynb): provided with features like distance of shot,type of shot, location etc and the task is to create a model to predict whether goal will be scored or not.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: retail_RFM](https://github.com/rahulk0407/PROJECTS/blob/master/retail_RFM_without_KNN/project3_RFM.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts.finding recency, frequency and money spent.
	- [mercedes](https://github.com/rahulk0407/PROJECTS/blob/master/mercedes/mercedes_project1.ipynb): Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.
	
	DeepLearning Random Kaggle competition

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [LDA_project](https://github.com/rahulk0407/NLP/blob/master/Topic%20modeling/nlp_project_play.ipynb): topic modeling using sklearn.analyzed the reviews of the product on Amazon and the topics that customers are talking about. performed topic modeling on specific parts of speech. 

	- [NLP ALL IN ONE](https://github.com/rahulk0407/NLP/blob/master/NLP.ipynb): this notebook contains many sub-topics ehich comes  under NLP.
	- [NLP using deepLearning](https://github.com/rahulk0407/NLP/blob/master/deepL_NLP.ipynb) a quick guide
	- [add emoji](https://github.com/rahulk0407/language-modeling/blob/master/add_emoji.py)
	- Currently working on translator model using encoder and decoder model, transformer and BERT. gaining more and more knowledge on these topic.
